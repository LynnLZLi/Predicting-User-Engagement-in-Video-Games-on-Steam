Writeup for Assignment 1: Video Game Recommender Systems

Part 1: Time Played Prediction

Objective: 

To predict the log-transformed hours a user is likely to spend playing a game.

Methodology:

Implemented a bias-based collaborative filtering model.
Model aims to predict a user's interaction with a game, focusing on the time played.

Data Processing:

Used the dataset train.json.gz for model training.
Split the dataset into training and validation subsets, with a predefined ratio to balance training and testing.

Model Details:

Computed a global average of hours played from the training data to serve as the baseline.
Implemented user and game biases. These biases represent individual deviations from the global average.
Applied iterative parameter updates to minimize the mean squared error (MSE). This approach helps in adjusting biases towards more accurate predictions.
Set the regularization parameter (lambda_reg) to 4.291, aiming to achieve a balance between overfitting and underfitting.
The prediction for each (user, game) pair is calculated as the sum of the global average hours, user bias, and game bias.

Results and Output:

Generated a CSV file named predictions_Hours.csv containing the predicted hours.
This file includes predictions for each (user, game) pair based on our model.


Part 2: Would Play Prediction

Objective: To predict whether a user would play a specific game.

Methodology:

Combined Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) with a popularity-based approach.
The model aims to predict a user's preference for a game, considering both personalized preferences and general popularity.

Data Processing:

Utilized the full dataset for the training of the BPR model.
Generated negative samples by pairing users with games they haven't played to balance the dataset.
Prepared validation data by including both played and not-played game instances.

Model Details:

BPR Model: Trained using the implicit library, setting factors to 5 to capture the underlying patterns in user-game interactions.
Popularity Model: Identified the most popular games based on play count, assuming higher popularity indicates a higher likelihood of being played.
The final prediction combines the BPR score and the game's popularity. The BPR score represents the likelihood of preference based on user-game interaction history, while popularity serves as a general indicator of a game's appeal.

Results and Output:

Created predictions_Played.csv containing predictions on whether a user would play a particular game.
Used an adjusted threshold for the BPR score to decide the final prediction, considering both BPR and popularity.
